# Minimalistic new tab
This app has been created by me.
Because recently I find app for android, that replaces home page with minimal black&white interface with no icons.
It helps me reduce phone usage by **50%**.
Then I start searching for something related in desktop web browsers, but can't find what I need.
So I build my own))
